# Bootstrap Percolation
Bootstrap Percolation is a model for the spreading of infection.
The criteria for the transmission of infection is that a cell must have at least 2 (in this case) infected neighbours. Once a cell has become infected, it remains infected.

I am by no means an expert. My little understanding of it came from Prof. Alexander Holroyd's [paper](http://aeholroyd.org/papers/cell.pdf), [webpage](http://aeholroyd.org/boot/) and a bit from speaking to him in person, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkJOz7-XO5s) by Stefan Tan.
